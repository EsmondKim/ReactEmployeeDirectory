## Description

This app is an Employee User Directory created using React.  The app allows you to summon a batch of employees, then the app allows you to filter and narrow the batch by employee first name.  The code takes advantage of React states and useEffect to make this search dynamic.  You can also sort the employees by their ID numbers or by their first names.  The app also makes use of a Router to facilitate differnt pages, includes a NavBar component with links to routes, and features a persistent footer on the bottom of all pages.

Here's a User Story for the App:
WHEN the USER loads the page, 
a table of random employees should render. 
The USER should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
